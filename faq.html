            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Q: "What is the best DPS Spec in BC?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: This is, without a doubt, the most asked question. While the decisions in picking what classes we want in a raid group are much more dependent upon factors like class diversity and raid utility, DPS does matter. The quickest answer is that classes that scale well with crit strike will typically be best in BC. This is because the majority of BC gear gives crit strike, whereas mastery does not exist and haste or versatility are harder to find (and in the case of haste often give less numerical amounts than other secondary stats available on other gear). This makes Fire Mage one of the strongest ranged DPS specs. Dual-wielding melee classes are also generally stronger in BC, and the legendary Twinblades of Azzinoth add much more power to the Combat Rogue. Please know that DPS specs having low DPS potential yet high raid utility have been taken by guild officers to avoid recruiting anyone into a "bad spec". As a side note, moving into WotLK and even further expansions with the same characters is an option that can be more rewarding than rerolling a new guy for each expansion, though ultimately that decision is entirely up to you.</h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "Wouldn't newer content be better content / Why not play Legion?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: This one doesn't always get asked in the form of a question, mainly because those asking it generally don't care what we have to say. If you have a problem with what we do, just leave our site and go on your merry way. There are however a number of reasons to play old content. Most argue the only reason people do this is nostalgia, however this is simply not the case. The gear system in older content levels is in many ways nicer and more satisfying than the heavily-RNG based loot system in Legion. The exansion was made back when BLizzard had a whole vault of warcraft lore to build off of (we later have an expansion based on an April Fool's Day prank, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it). Apart from what is better or worse, at the end of the day it is something different to do. WoW's endgame has always been built on the rough model of dragging out content, and when you are at that level having something else to break up your week and give you more enjoyment is welcomed. Your WoW sub is $15 a month if you play in one expansion or two, so why not get more content out of the deal? </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "Those raid times don't work for me ... Can you change them?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: The short answer on changing raid times outright is no. We have tried to make the most available schedule possible for the majority of players. Weekends are generally when most people have free time, and also tend not to interfere with people's Legion raiding. No raid is run consistently on the same time slot (the schedule rotates) so if you can't make one of the days/times you still will be getting to do all of the raids. As for adjusting times, moving a raid for one week, or other lesser arrangements, please be aware that there are a number of moving parts involved and organization to be done. We would be happy to make changes that work better for any guild member, though if a reschedule doesn't work for other members it likely will not happen. Please consider why it is that you cannot attend raids and think that there are other people with their own lives and schedules which are being adjusted to fit these times to determine if a request for a schedule change is a good idea. </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "The class / spec I want to play is not available on the roster. Can I still play it?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: Yes, though be cautious in making this decision. The requested classes and specs are not only those that are best performing in these rolls but also those that offer helpful raid utilities and other abilities that would benefit us much more than other classes or specs. The tentative roster is more of an ideal roster, with balanced distributions about armor types and tokens and maximized class diversity without sacrifice of effectiveness. We would like to avoid duplicate specs at all costs, specifically for tanks and healers, and we would like to avoid having more than two of a given class. The specs put onto the roster do represent a near-optimum raid group and as such you should consider how the specs or classes we may be suggesting for that role could be better than your desired selection. To summarize, be smart about breaking the roster, and please speak with us first about your selection as it may require increasing the size of the raid group. Be warned that some specs may be rather poor choices. </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "What is the loot system? GM loot! Can we trust you?!" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: The main reason that we use GM loot is because we recognize that there are a number of different factors to delegating loot beyond need/greed/pass. Out priority system goes something like this: <p>Current Tier BiS > Non-BiS Upgrade > Off-Spec Upgrade > New Transmog Appearance > Greed = Disenchant </p> We will always do rolls between all individuals who can use an item for the specified category. This is true for all items, even Legendaries. </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "Do you use voice chat? What program? Is it required?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: We do in fact use voice chat regularly. The Deadwind Dingers have a Discord channel with text and voice channels for members and officers. Do not be alarmed; this segregation is no form of elitism. The guild officers often play on characters other than our BC characters and have a separate channel for when our activties are totally irrelevant to the guild. We cannot force you to use Discord, however we strongly urge you to as many of our raid communications will be sent out over this network. You don't have to talk (though anyone is certainly welcome to!) but are encouraged to listen as the bulk of our raid communication will be done through this network. If this is going to be a problem, please contact us and we will see what can be done. If Discord proves troublesome for a number of players we will be happy to consider alternative means of guild communication. Discord is very light-weight and can be run through an internet browser, so no download is required to join in the voice channel. If you do decide to use your mic, be courteous and adjust the settings appropriately (we are happy to assist in these matters too!) </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "Who is Levinari and why is she banned?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: This is a complex and sensitive issue, but to satisfy general curiosity it will be said that the use of a very minor third-party macro was used on an alt character to perform very menial tasks involved in the collection of cosmetic items and Blizzard dropped the banhammer. For this reason Levinari will not be joining us, however we still recognize her as a member of our guild due to her many contributions in the early phases of the guild. </h3>

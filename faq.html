            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Q: "Wouldn't newer content be better content / Why not play Legion?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: This one doesn't always get asked in the form of a question, mainly because those asking it generally don't care what we have to say. If you have a problem with what we do, just leave our site and go on your merry way. If you are generally curious though, there are a number of reasons to play old content. Most argue the only reason people do this is nostalgia, however this is simply not the case. The gear system in older content levels is in many ways nicer and more satisfying than the heavily-RNG based personal loot system in Legion (and let's not talk about Legion Legendaries). The exansion was made back when Blizzard had a whole vault of warcraft lore to build off of and didn't have to retcon and resurrect there way to an expansion (we later have an expansion based on an April Fool's Day prank, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it). Apart from what is better or worse, at the end of the day it is something different to do. WoW's endgame has always been built on the rough model of dragging out content, and when you are at that level of play, having something else to break up your week and give you more enjoyment is often welcomed. Your WoW sub is $15 a month if you play in one expansion or two, so why not get more content out of the deal? </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "Those raid times don't work for me ... Can you change them?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: The short answer on changing raid times outright is no. We have tried to make the most available schedule possible for the majority of players. Weekends are generally when most people have free time, and also tend not to interfere with people's Legion raiding. No raid is run consistently on the same time slot (the schedule rotates) so if you can't make one of the days/times you still will be getting to do all of the raids. As for adjusting times, moving a raid for one week, or other lesser arrangements, please be aware that there are a number of moving parts involved and organization to be done. We would be happy to make changes that work better for any guild member, though if a reschedule doesn't work for other members it likely will not happen. Please consider why it is that you cannot attend raids and think that there are other people with their own lives and schedules which are being adjusted to fit these times to determine if a request for a schedule change is a good idea. </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "Can I play a race / class that was released after the expansion we are playing in?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: Yes. If you are rolling a new character, we encourage you not to do this, but ultimately your character is of your creation. Remember that progression restrictions apply all the same, and that being an out-of-content class will give notably fewer gear opportunities due to lack of gear tokens. </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "What is the loot system?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: We use need/greed, though when an item drops there is often a lot of discussion on who really 'needs' an item. Our priority system goes something like this: <p>Current Tier BiS > Non-BiS Upgrade > Off-Spec Upgrade > New Transmog Appearance > Greed = Disenchant </p> We will always do rolls between all individuals who can use an item for the specified category. This is true for all items, even Legendaries. </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "How are bank resources distributed?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: In short, if you need it, ask and you shall receive. What we won't give mats for are things like crafting an item only for the transmog or using rare gems to socket a subpar pieces of gear. If the guild is not in favor of granting you materials, then you can always get the mats yourself and have a guild member perform the cuts or enchants or craft that you desire. </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "What kind of gear can we use?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: If the raid is not marked as part of a progression project then there is no gear rule. For progression projects it's pretty simple: Use gear in content. Each raid tier has an ilvl cap, so we will be watching to ensure you do not exceed this cap on any item. Furthermore, do not use items from later expansions for any progression project. If you aren't sure about something you can always ask! </h3><br>
            
             <h2>Q: "There are no guides on playing raid content at low levels ... What stats do I build? How do I gear up?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: Stats are generally of the same relative priorities in low levels as they are at max, provided the benefit from those stats are not closely tied to abilities you do not yet have. You should note in gearing that sockets are very powerful at lower level brackets. Use your judgement, and think of the numbers that factor into your power. We are always happy to help you figure out exactly what gear you should be trying to get as well as assist in the gearing process from Heroic dungeons to get you performing in raid at your very best. </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "Do you use voice chat? What program? Is it required?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: We do in fact use voice chat regularly. The Deadwind Dingers have a Discord channel with text and voice channels. The appropriate voice channel will be used in all raids. We cannot force you to use Discord, however we strongly urge you to as many of our raid communications will be sent out over this network. You don't have to talk (though anyone is certainly welcome to!) but are encouraged to listen in to hear fight descriptions, boss strategies, and mid-fight calls. If this is going to be a problem, please contact us and we will see what can be done. Discord is very light-weight and can be run through an internet browser, so no download is required to join in the voice channel. If you do decide to use your mic, be courteous and adjust the settings appropriately (we are happy to assist in these matters too!) </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "Who is Levinari and why is she banned?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: This is a complex and sensitive issue, but to satisfy general curiosity it will be said that the use of a very minor third-party macro was used on an alt character to perform very menial tasks involved in the collection of cosmetic items and Blizzard dropped the banhammer. For this reason Levinari will not be joining us, however we still recognize her as a member of our guild due to her many contributions in the early phases of the guild. </h3>

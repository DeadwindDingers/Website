            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Q: "What is the best DPS Spec in BC?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: This is, without a doubt, the most asked question. While the decisions in picking what classes we want in a raid group are much more dependent upon factors like class diversity and raid utility, DPS does matter. The quickest answer is that classes that scale well with crit strike will typically be best in BC. This is because the majority of BC gear gives crit strike, whereas mastery does not exist and haste or versatility are harder to find (and in the case of haste often give less numerical amounts than other secondary stats available on other gear). This makes Fire Mage one of the strongest ranged DPS specs. Dual-wielding melee classes are also generally stronger in BC, and the legendary Twinblades of Azzinoth add much more power to the Combat Rogue. Please know that DPS specs having low DPS potential yet high raid utility have been taken by guild officers to avoid recruiting anyone into a "bad spec". As a side note, the strength of many picks change drastically once in WotLK, so consider the fact that optimizing DPS in each expansion would likely mean rerolling a few times. Moving into WotLK and even further expansions with the same characters is an option that can be faster and more rewarding than rerolling a new guy for each expansion, though ultimately that decision is entirely up to you.</h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "Wouldn't newer content be better content / Why not play Legion?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: This one doesn't always get asked in the form of a question, mainly because those asking it generally don't care what we have to say. If you have a problem with what we do, just leave our site and go on your merry way. If you are generally curious though, there are a number of reasons to play old content. Most argue the only reason people do this is nostalgia, however this is simply not the case. The gear system in older content levels is in many ways nicer and more satisfying than the heavily-RNG based loot system in Legion. The exansion was made back when Blizzard had a whole vault of warcraft lore to build off of and didn't have to retcon and resurrect there way to an expansion (we later have an expansion based on an April Fool's Day prank, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it). Apart from what is better or worse, at the end of the day it is something different to do. WoW's endgame has always been built on the rough model of dragging out content, and when you are at that level of play, having something else to break up your week and give you more enjoyment is often welcomed. Your WoW sub is $15 a month if you play in one expansion or two, so why not get more content out of the deal? </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "Those raid times don't work for me ... Can you change them?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: The short answer on changing raid times outright is no. We have tried to make the most available schedule possible for the majority of players. Weekends are generally when most people have free time, and also tend not to interfere with people's Legion raiding. No raid is run consistently on the same time slot (the schedule rotates) so if you can't make one of the days/times you still will be getting to do all of the raids. As for adjusting times, moving a raid for one week, or other lesser arrangements, please be aware that there are a number of moving parts involved and organization to be done. We would be happy to make changes that work better for any guild member, though if a reschedule doesn't work for other members it likely will not happen. Please consider why it is that you cannot attend raids and think that there are other people with their own lives and schedules which are being adjusted to fit these times to determine if a request for a schedule change is a good idea. </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "The class / spec I want to play is not listed as required on the roster. Can I still play it?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: Yes, though be cautious in making this decision. The requested classes and specs are not only those that are best performing in these rolls but also those that offer helpful raid utilities and other abilities that would benefit us much more than other classes or specs. The required roster is more of an ideal roster, with balanced distributions about armor types and tokens as well as maximized class diversity without sacrifice of effectiveness. We would like to avoid duplicate specs at all costs, specifically for tanks and healers, and we would like to avoid having more than two of a given class. The specs put onto the roster do represent a near-optimum raid group and as such you should consider how the specs or classes we may be suggesting for that role could be better than your desired selection. To summarize, be smart about breaking the roster, and please speak with us first about your selection as it may require increasing the size of the raid group. Be warned that some specs may be rather poor choices due to being exceptionally inviable in BC. </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "Can I play a race / class that was released after BC?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: Yes, though with harsh limitations. For as long as you remain an out-of-content character (until we reach the expansion of your race's / class's release) your guildmates will hold a loot priority over you on need rolls. We know the Death Knight is enticing because it requires very little levelling, but filling a BC raid guild with a collection of Death Knights is quite foolish! Remember that a number of players will be trying to enjoy as much immersion in the expansion as possible, and your selection to intentionally break content is rude and damaging to the positive experience of all of those players. </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "What is the loot system? GM loot! Can we trust you?!" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: The main reason that we use GM loot is because we recognize that there are a number of different factors to delegating loot beyond need/greed/pass. Out priority system goes something like this: <p>Current Tier BiS > Non-BiS Upgrade > Off-Spec Upgrade > New Transmog Appearance > Greed = Disenchant </p> We will always do rolls between all individuals who can use an item for the specified category. This is true for all items, even Legendaries. </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "How are bank resources distributed?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: In short, if you need it, ask and you shall receive. If you need a BC mat that we don't have, we can get you some quickly. We are happy to let you use our primal stores to craft those powerful pre-raid epics. If you get a new raid drop, we'd be happy to gem it up right there on the spot. What we won't give mats for are things like crafting an item only for the transmog, using rare gems to socket a subpar piece of gear. The general cutoff we use for when a piece of gear deserves gems/enchants is this: if there is a better pre-raid option from a normal/heroic dungeon drop, non-raid world event (such as Terokk), or especially a purchase from G'eras we will not be spending mats upgrading that item. If the particular item needed is in excess it may not matter, but to conserve our rarer mats this rule of thumb will be applied. If you really want a meta gem cut into a shoddy helmet, feel free to get the mats and we'll be happy to aid you in crafting it. </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "What kind of gear can we use?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: It's pretty simple: Use gear in content. Don't buy a WotLK green off of the AH, or use overpowered holiday event gear, or equip your heirlooms. Not only does it break content and oppose what we are trying to do, it's generally not needed. Most BC gear is honestly quite strong, especially socket gear. As long as your gear is in the content range of the current expansion we are playing in it is OK. That said, being able to earn your gear from raiding can be a lot more satisfying than bringing in your already-geared 70 who you carried through raids to gear up, though ultimately if you chose to use such methods to obtain gear you will not be penalized in any way. </h3><br>
            
             <h2>Q: "There are no guides on playing at level 70 ... What stats do I build? How do I gear up?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: Stats are generally of the same relative priorities in BC as they are in Legion, provided the benefit from those stats are not closely tied to abilities you do not yet have. That being said, not all gear in BC has it's secondary stats weighted equal. Getting even 10% haste will cost you heavily, but getting high crit can happen without even trying. The one most important rule in BC gear is that SOCKETS ARE AMAZING. It doesn't really matter what role or class or spec you play or what you want to gem in it. Most of these sockets, once filled with T6 gems, make socket gear notably stronger than any other available item. A 3-socket item from 10-man Karazhan will be better than the 0-socket drops you see 7 raids later in Sunwell. Use your judgement, and think of the numbers that factor into your power. We are always happy to help you figure out exactly what gear you should be trying to get as well as assist in the gearing process from Heroic dungeons to get you performing in raid at your very best. </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "Do you use voice chat? What program? Is it required?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: We do in fact use voice chat regularly. The Deadwind Dingers have a Discord channel with text and voice channels for members and officers. Do not be alarmed; this segregation is no form of elitism. The guild officers often play on characters other than our BC characters and have a separate channel for when our activties are totally irrelevant to the guild. The public voice channel will be used in all raids. We cannot force you to use Discord, however we strongly urge you to as many of our raid communications will be sent out over this network. You don't have to talk (though anyone is certainly welcome to!) but are encouraged to listen as the bulk of our raid communication will be done through this network. If this is going to be a problem, please contact us and we will see what can be done. If Discord proves troublesome for a number of players we will be happy to consider alternative means of guild communication. Discord is very light-weight and can be run through an internet browser, so no download is required to join in the voice channel. If you do decide to use your mic, be courteous and adjust the settings appropriately (we are happy to assist in these matters too!) </h3><br>
            
            <h2>Q: "Who is Levinari and why is she banned?" </h2><br>
            <h3>A: This is a complex and sensitive issue, but to satisfy general curiosity it will be said that the use of a very minor third-party macro was used on an alt character to perform very menial tasks involved in the collection of cosmetic items and Blizzard dropped the banhammer. For this reason Levinari will not be joining us, however we still recognize her as a member of our guild due to her many contributions in the early phases of the guild. </h3>

                “A Retail-Based Legacy BC Raiding Guild” - A Breakdown

            <p>&emsp; Retail-Based: First off, we play on retail WoW. No illegal private servers with the overhanging fear of losing your account. We support Blizzard (even at times when we disagree with them) and respect them for the game they have created. While the decision may be unorthodox, we do not allow the current retail setting to prevent us from playing and enjoying the massive amount of content still available in WoW through previous expansions.</p>

            <p>&emsp; Legacy: This term gets thrown around a bit, but in the sense you see it here we mean to say that we are interested in all of WoW's content before the current expansion, with a heavy focus on earlier content. We aren’t a guild for advancing in the current expansion, levelling to max, or anything like that. We want to play through the full spectrum of WoW’s content and raids, and we want to do this with a core community of fellow players. </p>
            
            <p>&emsp; BC: The Burning Crusade was WoW’s 1st expansion, and is where our adventure begins (unfortunately, so little of vanilla WoW’s content remains after Cataclysm and raid-recycling that we don’t feel it would be good for our purposes, though we aren't opposed to revisiting vanilla with different characters at a notably later time). The Burning Crusade released 9 raid instances, 8 of which remain perfectly intact. By turning off xp gains on level 70 characters, we are able to play at the BC level cap for which these raids are tailored. </p>

            <p>&emsp; Raiding: We enjoy questing Outland and running Heroic dungeons as much as the next guy (a lot more in fact, though that isn't the point). Unfortunately, these tasks have been made notably easier with the “stat crunches” WoW has used to retune the late game and make the game overall easier. While this admittedly isn’t much of a good thing, these “crunches” are able to help us is in the context of raids: The current stat and ability system in place means that running core BC raids which used to require 25 players is now a feasible task for a party of nearly half of that capacity. Getting a balanced population into these raids, assessing how our current Legion abilities may advantage or disadvantage us in old fights, and of course conquering these tasks is our primary goal. We intend to move tier by tier, and will carry our progression as far as we can. </p>

            <p>&emsp; Guild: Why am I defining the word guild? Because our definition may vary from what currently is accepted as a guild. Most raiding guilds exist simply to organize the raid roster. We Deadwind Dingers have assembled a network via in game guild functionality, a discord channel, a guild email account managed by officers, and our own website. Don’t let all of this organization and work fool you though: at the end of the day, we are a casual, relaxed guild that values independent play on these characters or others as well as grouping up to take on our guild’s latest challenges. At it's core, we are a gateway through which  </p><br><br><br><br>

            <p>DISCLAIMER: The following tale is overly dramatic and highly romanticized. This tale is..
                based on a true story. </p>
            <p> &emsp; Long ago, in the approximate time region that was the summer of 2007, a young human warrior by the name of Zephyrus had nearly risen to the ranks of the greatest warriors in all of Azeroth. He had seen adventures from the Arathi Highlands to the Blasted Lands; this great warrior had conquered beasts and completed quests throughout the Eastern Kingdoms. With the opening of the Dark Portal the mightiest of champions had all ventured into Outland, leaving Zephyrus without the companionship needed for dungeon-delving. Without considering the possibility of adventures in Kalimdor, the young warrior became dismayed by what little call to adventure remained within his now-safe kingdom. Finally he found hope in in the form of a small, desolate, untravelled sector of the Eastern Kingdoms: The Deadwind Pass. </p>
            <p>&emsp; The region was dead. Not a sound could be heard. No merchant dared set up shop, no flight master dared offer transit. The Pass was a graveyard. The lone warrior ran through the grey crevasses in search of anyone, any sign of life or direction. He found nothing. The only thing here to be found was a scattered collection of mobs, so he did the one thing that the World of Warcraft teaches a man to do:</p>
            <br>
            <p>He grinded...</p>
            <br>
            <p>&emsp; Zephyrus turned the grey stone wasteland into his killing fields, returning day after day to grind mobs that gave abysmally low quantities of experience. The process lasted for weeks. He had heard that the trials required to reach the maximum level of power was tremendous, and accepted this as the required trial. He would not surrender.</p>
            <p>&emsp; At last the day came when the last spider shrivelled into the dusty ground and he heard ringing through his ears the greatest sound an adventurer could hear. Ding! With excessive pride Zephyrus exclaimed to his guildmates how he had finally obtained his next level of greatness within Deadwind Pass. He expected praise, respect, or at a minimum shallow congratulations, yet what he received was confusion and disbelief, which gave way into mockery and ridicule. The plight had been foolish. There existed dozens of quests within the offshore regions of Azshara and Silithus, and he had the necessary power to venture into Outland as well. Deadwind Pass wasn’t the crown to Zephyrus’s mighty ventures; Deadwind Pass wasn’t even fit for adventuring. Zephyrus had wasted much of his life in those deadening hills for an accomplishment that meant practically nothing.</p>
            <p>&emsp; Nearly 10 years later the spirit of the old warrior Zephyrus has reincarnated into a new hero, and new adventures await. When the time came to assemble a banner for his allies, he thought of what feelings and goals should guide this new guild of heroes. He considered how significant every region of Azeroth felt to him back in those glory days, how a guild used to feel unique in its character, community and vision, how his adventures had always been a bit different from what every other hero was off doing, and how satisfying it felt to complete a challenge that many would not even consider attempting. It is this essence of the World of Warcraft that we attempt to recreate in our adventures and experiences together, and these ideals are manifested in no purer tale than in the plight of the deadwind dinger. </p>
            <p>&emsp; Or, perhaps we simply found the name to be funny... </p>
